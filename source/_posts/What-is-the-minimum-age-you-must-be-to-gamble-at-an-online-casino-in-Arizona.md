#  What is the process for filing a complaint against an online casino in Arizona?

If you have a grievance against an online casino operating in Arizona, the first step is to contact the Arizona Attorney General’s Office (AGO). The AGO is responsible for investigating and prosecuting violations of the state’s gambling laws.

You can file a complaint against an online casino by visiting the AGO website and completing the complaint form. Be sure to provide as much information as possible, including the name of the casino, the date of the incident, and any documentation or evidence you have.

Once your complaint is received, the AGO will investigate the allegations and determine whether further action is warranted. If appropriate, the AGO may file a lawsuit against the casino or refer the case to another law enforcement agency.

It’s important to note that filing a complaint against an online casino is not a guarantee of success. The AGO has limited resources and must prioritize cases based on their severity and potential impact on public safety. However, filing a complaint may be your best chance at getting justice if you believe you have been wronged by an online casino.
