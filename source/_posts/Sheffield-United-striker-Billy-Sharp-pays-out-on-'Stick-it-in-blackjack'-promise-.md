Sheffield United striker Billy Sharp has made good on his promise to pay out £1,000 to any fan who could stick the ball in the back of the net from inside his own half during a game.

Sharp, who pledged to make the payout if anyone could manage the feat, was true to his word as United faced Charlton Athletic over the weekend. 

An injury time goal by Blades midfielder John Fleck ensured that Sharp would be forking out, with one supporter taking home the cash prize. 

Speaking after the game, Sharp said: "It's always nice to keep your promise and I'm glad John got us the winning goal in the end. It was a great team performance and hopefully we can continue this run going forward." 

The 31-year old striker has been in fine form this season, scoring eight times in all competitions as Sheffield United push for promotion back to the Championship.

Stoke City winger Xherdan Shaqiri has fulfilled his promise to pay out on 'Stick it in blackjack' should he score against former club Liverpool.

Shaqiri came off the bench to score a stunning late winner for Stoke at the bet365 Stadium, and afterwards revealed he had made a pledge to team-mate Joe Allen before the game.

"I said to Joe before the game that I would put it in blackjack if I scored," Shaqiri told BT Sport. "I am very happy that I have scored and also that I have kept my promise."

Allen was among the first to congratulate Shaqiri on his goal, and the midfielder was clearly delighted with his team-mate's strike.

"It was a great goal by Xherdan and I'm really pleased for him," Allen said. "To score against your old club is always nice but to do it in front of the Kop – who were giving him a bit of stick – makes it even better."

Speaking after the final game of the season against Bolton Wanderers, Pantilimon said: "I'm very happy that we have avoided relegation and I'm glad that I could pay out on my promise to the fans.

Bradley Dack made good on his promise to pay out £100 to any fan who could name the song he had referenced in a post-match interview. The Blackburn Rovers midfielder had promised to foot the bill if anyone could tell him the name of the track he had sung after scoring against Hull City.

"It was just a bit of banter with the fans, but I'm glad someone managed to get it right," said Dack after Blackburn's 3-1 win. "I'll make sure everyone gets their £100 now."

The song in question is Stick it in by The Darkness, and Dack revealed that he had been singing it in the changing room before matches for a bit of inspiration.

"I've been singing it in the dressing room before games for a while and it seems to be working at the moment," said Dack. "Hopefully I can keep scoring and keep the fans happy."
