#  discover the fifty-two cards counting technique that offers an advantage of up to three percent 

The fifty-two cards counting technique is a mathematical strategy used in blackjack to give the player an advantage over the house. The technique is based on the assumption that the player will be dealt a blackjack (Ace and 10) approximately once every twenty-one hands. By keeping track of the ratio of Aces to 10s received, the player can adjust their bets accordingly for maximum gain.

The first step in utilizing this technique is to divide the deck of cards evenly into four piles after shuffling. Leave one pile untouched and divide each of the remaining three piles in half. Place those piles face down in front of you to create your first stack. 
After each hand is played, add the card from that hand to either of the two remaining stacks, depending on whether or not it was an Ace or 10. For example, if you are dealt an Ace and 6, add the Ace to your first stack and place the 6 in your other (second) stack. If you are then dealt a 9 and 2, add both cards to your second stack as they are both numerically less than 10.
During play, if you ever come across an Ace and 10 (blackjack), set those cards aside and continue playing with only three stacks. When you finish all hands, count up how many cards are in each of your four stacks (remembering which one had the blackjack). If there are an equal number of cards in each stack then you have broken even; however, if there are more cards in one stack than another, that stack represents your net gain or loss for that particular round of blackjack. 

A few extra tips: 
-If you have already placed a bet when receiving your blackjack, double it! 
-You should also increase your bet when getting close to 21 (less than 3 away), as there is a higher likelihood of drawing another card and going bust.

#  playing blackjack like a mathematician gives you the edge against the house 

Blackjack is one of the casino games that players can use mathematical techniques to gain an edge over the house. While basic strategy can be used to lower the house edge, there are other techniques that advanced players can use to tilt the odds even further in their favour.

One such technique is card counting. This involves keeping track of what cards have been played, so that you can gauge when there are more high or low cards left in the deck. By betting higher when there are more high cards left and lower when there are more low cards left, you can make more money in the long run.

Another technique is called “edge sorting”. This takes advantage of inconsistencies in how casinos deal their cards. By keeping track of which cards have been dealt face up, and which have been dealt face down, you can increase your chances of winning by taking advantage of which cards are still left in the deck.

While these techniques require a fair bit of practice to master, they can give you a significant edge over the house when playing blackjack. So if you’re looking for a way to increase your chances of winning at the casino, give these techniques a try – you may be surprised at how successful you can be!

#  how to use basic strategy to get closer to 21 without going bust 

In blackjack, the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible while still beating the dealer. A player can achieve this by using basic strategy, which is a set of rules that dictate the best way to play each hand.

There are a few different basic strategy charts depending on whether the player is playing with one or two decks. In general, players should stand when they have a total of 17 or more, hit when they have 16 or less, and double down when they have 11 or more.

Following these guidelines will help players stay closer to 21 without going bust. In addition, keeping track of the dealers upcard will help players make informed decisions about when to hit and stand.

Some basic tips for beginners include: always split aces and eights, never take insurance, and only double down when you have a good hand. As you gain more experience, you will begin to learn about more complex strategies such as card counting and shuffle tracking.

Card counting is a technique that allows players to keep track of the cards that have been played, in order to make better decisions about when to bet and when to hold back. It takes a bit of practice to get the hang of it, but it can be a very effective way to improve your odds of winning.
