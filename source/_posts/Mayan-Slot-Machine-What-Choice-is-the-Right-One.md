#  How to Play the Mayan Slot Machine

The Mayan slot machine is a five-reel and twenty-payline slot game that is available both online and on mobile devices. The game is based on the ancient Mayan civilization, and its symbols include pyramids, temples, and other icons related to that era.

To play the Mayan slot machine, you first need to choose your bet amount. This can be done by clicking on the various bet amounts at the bottom of the screen. The minimum bet is one penny, while the maximum bet is $500. Once you have selected your bet amount, you can then spin the reels by clicking on the circular arrow button located in the center of the screen.

If you would like to gamble any of your winnings, you can do so by clicking on the “ gamble” button below the reels. This will open up a new window where you can choose from red or black, or whether the next card will be higher or lower than the previous one. If you are successful in guessing correctly, your winnings will be doubled. However, if you guess incorrectly, you will lose all of your winnings from that spin.

The Mayan slot machine offers a number of bonus features, including free spins and a bonus game. The free spins are activated when three or more scatter symbols (indicated by a picture of a compass) appear anywhere on the reels. You will then be awarded ten free spins during which all of your winnings will be tripled. The bonus game is activated when three or more bonus symbols (indicated by a picture of a pyramid) appear anywhere on the reels. In this game, you must choose from nine panels to reveal either prizes or multipliers. If you reveal three matching prizes, you will win that prize multiplied by your original bet amount.
