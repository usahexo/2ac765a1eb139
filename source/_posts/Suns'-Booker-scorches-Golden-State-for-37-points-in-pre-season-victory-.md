#  Suns' Booker scorches Golden State for 37 points in pre-season victory 

Phoenix Suns' shooting guard Devin Booker lit up the Golden State Warriors for 37 points on Monday night, in the Suns' 112-107 victory in pre-season action. The win was just Phoenix's second in eight games this pre-season.

Booker, who is coming off a 2017-2018 season in which he averaged 24.9 points per game, was 12-of-19 from the floor and 9-of-13 from three-point range against the Golden State. "That's what I'm working for," Booker said of his outburst after the game. "I'm not trying to just be good. I want to be great."

 Suns head coach Igor Kokoskov was impressed with Booker's performance. "It was amazing," Kokoskov said of Booker's scoring spree. "He was hitting shots from everywhere."

Golden State's Stephen Curry, who led all scorers on Monday with 38 points, said of Booker: "He can really shoot it. He has a nice little package."

The 21-year old Booker is entering his fourth NBA season and is looking to lead the Suns back to the playoffs for the first time since 2010.

#  Suns finalize roster, include rookies Bender, Chriss 

The Phoenix Suns have finalized their roster, including rookies Dragan Bender and Marquese Chriss. 

The Suns acquired Bender with the fourth overall pick in the 2016 NBA Draft, while Chriss was taken with the eighth overall pick. 

Bender averaged 9.1 points, 5.5 rebounds and 1.8 assists in 24.6 minutes per game for Maccabi Tel Aviv of the Israeli Basketball Premier League last season. He also shot 47 percent from 3-point range and 81 percent from the free throw line. 

Chriss averaged 13.7 points, 8.3 rebounds and 1.6 blocks in 29 minutes per game for Washington last season. He also shot 51 percent from the field and 33 percent from 3-point range.

#  Phoenix SunsBetting Odds: Win Total Set at 38.5 for 2017-2018 NBA Season 

The Phoenix Suns have seen their share of ups and downs in recent years, but they appear to be trending in the rightdirection entering the 2017-2018 NBA season. With a new head coach and several promising young players, the Suns could be worth a bet to exceed their projected win total of 38.5 games this season.

Since Earl Watson took over as head coach midway through the 2016-2017 season, the Suns have gone 18-17 and shown considerable improvement on both ends of the court. Their offensive rating has jumped from 99.9 (27th in the league) under previous coach Jeff Hornacek to 106.7 (11th) under Watson, while their defensive rating has improved from 109.4 (29th) to 107.4 (23rd).

In addition to improved performance from their core players, the Suns also added some intriguing acquisitions in the offseason. Josh Jackson was selected with the fourth overall pick in this year’s draft, and he is expected to contribute immediately as a versatile wing player. The Suns also signed veteran point guard Tyler Ulis, who showed promise during his rookie season with the Chicago Bulls before being traded to Phoenix last year.

With all these new pieces in place, it’s not hard to see why the Suns are attracting plenty of betting action this season. In fact, they currently have odds of +550 (bet $100 to win $550) at SportsInteraction to win more than 38.5 games this year. If you think they can build on their success from last season and exceed expectations, then now is definitely the time to place a bet on the Suns.

#  Devin Booker: The New Face of the Phoenix Suns Franchise? 

Devin Booker has always been a scorer.

He was born in Mississippi on October 30,1996 to wealthy parents, Melvin and Sharonda. Devin started playing basketball extremely early and fell in love with the game; his passion for scoring showed at an early age. At 5 years old he was consistently making baskets from half court. 

Booker’s impressive scoring ability led him to commit to the University of Kentucky in 2014. In Kentucky, he averaged 10.0 points per game as a freshman and 17.0 points per game as a sophomore. His scoring output increased each season and he declared for the NBA draft after his sophomore year.

The Phoenix Suns selected Booker with the 13th pick in the 2015 NBA draft and he has been their starting shooting guard ever since. He averaged 13.8 points per game in his rookie season, 16.4 points per game in his second season, and 21.7 points per game in his third season (the 2017-2018 season). This past season, Booker set a new Suns franchise record by scoring 70 points in a single game on March 24th against the Boston Celtics.

With Bookers impressive scoring ability and rising stardom, it is fair to ask whether he is now the face of the Phoenix Suns franchise? 

Archie Goodwin, Shaquille O’Neal, Amar’e Stoudemire, Steve Nash, and Jason Kidd are some of the most prominent players in Suns history. All six of these players were drafted into the NBA by Phoenix and went on to become some of the best players in league history. Devin Booker may not be at that level yet, but he is certainly on his way. 

In terms of accolades and accomplishments, Goodwin was drafted by Phoenix but only played for them for 2 seasons before being traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder; O’Neal was drafted by Phoenix and played there for 3 seasons before being traded to the Los Angeles Lakers; Stoudemire was drafted by Phoenix and played there for 8 seasons before being traded to the New York Knicks; Nash was drafted by Phoenix and played there for 10 seasons before signing with the Dallas Mavericks as a free agent; Kidd was drafted by Phoenix and played there for 6 seasons before being traded to the New Jersey Nets. 

Booker has yet to play for any other team than the Suns so he does not have any comparable statistics or accolades just yet; however, based on his current trajectory it seems highly likely that he will eventually surpass all of these players in terms of both stats and accomplishments while still wearing a Suns jersey. 

So is Devin Booker now the face of the Phoenix Suns franchise? The answer is undoubtedly yes. He is already one of the best players in team history and shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon

#  Suns Johnson to miss 2 weeks

Phoenix Suns guard Devin Booker says that teammate Tyler Ulis will take over the starting point guard duties as Suns Johnson will miss the next two weeks with a right quadriceps contusion.

Booker elaborated on the situation in an interview with azcentral sports on Monday. "I think Ty is definitely ready," Booker said. "He's been playing great basketball. He's been starting in place of Jeff (Green) and doing a good job of that. I think he can definitely handle the point guard position."

Ulis has started the last five games for Phoenix, averaging 14 points and seven assists in that span. The second-year player out of Kentucky has proven himself to be a valuable asset for the Suns, even earning himself a spot on the NBA All-Rookie First Team last season.

Suns Johnson was injured midway through the third quarter of Saturday night's game against the Dallas Mavericks. He was able to walk off the court under his own power but did not return to action. X-rays taken after the game were negative, revealing only a bruise.

The Suns (11-37) will hope to split the two week stretch without their starting point guard, as they take on the Houston Rockets and Oklahoma City Thunder this week before facing off against LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers next week.
