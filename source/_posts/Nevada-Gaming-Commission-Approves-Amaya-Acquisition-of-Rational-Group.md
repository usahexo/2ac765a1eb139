#  Nevada Gaming Commission Approves Amaya Acquisition of Rational Group

The Nevada Gaming Commission has given its approval for the Amaya Gaming Group to acquire the Rational Group, the parent company of PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker. The acquisition, first announced in August, is valued at $4.9 billion.

"The commission conducted a very thorough review of this transaction and we are satisfied that Amaya is suitable to own and operate these gaming properties," said Chairman Tony Alamo of the Nevada Gaming Commission.

The Rational Group, which is based in Isle of Man, operates the world's two largest online poker sites. The company has been struggling in recent years due to a US crackdown on online gambling. Amaya Gaming, which is based in Canada, is a leading supplier of online casino games.

Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, Amaya will pay $660 million in cash and issue approximately 17.7 million common shares to the former shareholders of Rational Group. In addition, Amaya will assume approximately $1.3 billion in debt from Rational Group.

Amaya CEO David Baazov said that the acquisition will create "the world's largest publicly traded online poker company." He also predicted that it would lead to "significant growth opportunities for Amaya both through regulatory changes and new product launches."

US regulators have yet to give their approval for the acquisition, but it is expected that they will do so in due course.

#  William Hill Pledges to Keep Gibraltar Operation Independent After Amaya Deal

In a move that provides some assurance to Gibraltarians, William Hill has announced that it will maintain its Gibraltar operation as an independent entity following the company’s sale to Amaya Gaming. The decision means that the jobs of the 400 employees currently working at William Hill Gibraltar will be secure, and that the company’s famous brand will continue to be used in the territory.

The news comes as a relief to many in Gibraltar, where there was concern that the William Hill brand would be lost in a merger with Amaya, and that jobs would be lost in the process. In a statement released on Monday, Willam Hill Chairman Gareth Davis said that the company is committed to its Gibraltar operation.

“We are fully committed to our Gibraltar operation which will remain an important part of our global business post-acquisition,” he said. “We have been working closely with the Government of Gibraltar and key stakeholders in order to ensure that our operation there continues to thrive and we are very pleased to have their support.”

The assurances from William Hill come as a major relief for Gibraltarians, who have been anxious about the impact that the sale of William Hill to Amaya could have on their territory. Officials in Gibraltar have been lobbying hard for guarantees that the jobs of Gibraltarian workers would be safe and that the brand would remain intact, and they are likely pleased with Monday’s announcement from William Hill.

William Hill’s decision is also good news for Amaya, which has been eager to acquire the company in order to gain a foothold in the British gambling market. The move will give Amaya access to William Hill’s online platform, which has over 2 million customers worldwide.

#  New Jersey Online Gambling Firm Hopes to Cash in on Regulated US Market

#

# When New Jersey legalized online gambling in 2013, it was the first state in the US to do so. Now, one of the firms that has been granted a license to offer online gambling in the state is hoping to cash in on the regulated market.

#

# Atlantic City-based Resorts Casino Hotel is one of the companies that has been licensed to offer online gambling in New Jersey. The company is now teaming up with UK-based GVC Holdings PLC to offer a new online gambling platform called Ocean Resort Casino. The new platform will offer a range of casino games, including slots, blackjack, and roulette.

#

# Atlantic City has been struggling in recent years, and Resorts Casino Hotel is hoping that the launch of Ocean Resort Casino will help revive the local economy. The new platform is expected to create hundreds of jobs in Atlantic City, and it could also help to attract more tourists to the area.

#

# GVC Holdings PLC already operates several online gambling platforms in Europe, and it is confident that Ocean Resort Casino will be a success in the US market. The company plans to invest heavily in marketing and advertising for the new platform, and it expects to see strong growth over the next few years.

#  Australian Online Gambling Firm May Benefit from Amaya Deal

An Australian online gambling firm may be the beneficiary of Montreal-based Amaya Inc.’s $4.9 billion acquisition of Rational Group, the parent company of PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker.

The Rational Group operates under licenses in more than 80 countries and is one of the world’s largest online poker companies. The purchase, which was announced Monday, is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year.

"This is a transformational deal for our company," said David Baazov, Amaya's CEO in a statement. "It creates a global leader in online gaming with annual revenues of more than $1 billion and over 25 million customers."

Australian betting firm Tatts Group Ltd., which operates The TattsBet, Tabcorp and Ubet brands, saw its stock price spike 5 percent on news of the deal Monday morning. In a note to investors, analysts at investment bank Macquarie said that the Rational Group's well-known brands will give Amaya a strong presence in Europe and Latin America.

Tatts Group Ltd. has been locked in a bidding war with billionaire casino magnate James Packer's Crown Resorts Ltd. for control of racetrack betting company Echo Entertainment Group Ltd. That battle is now likely over, with Crown withdrawing its bid last week after Australia's competition watchdog said it would not approve the sale on grounds it would reduce competition in the country's gambling market.

"We see Tatts as a likely winner from today's news with Crown likely no longer interested in Echo Entertainment," wrote Macquarie analysts Daniel Moore and Juliana Roadley.

#  PokerStars Parent Company Amaya Completes Acquisition of CrownBet

The PokerStars parent company Amaya completed its acquisition of Australian betting firm CrownBet on Monday.

The all-cash deal is worth Aus$300 million (US$228 million) and will see Amaya become the largest online wagering company in Australia.

"This acquisition represents an important step in our international growth strategy and will see Amaya become the market leader in online wagering in Australia," said CEO Rafi Ashkenazi in a statement.

CrownBet operates as a sports bookmaker and online casino, and has more than 2 million registered customers. The company said that the deal will see it "leverage its technology to drive innovation and growth" across its product offering.

For Amaya, the move is another step in its global expansion plans. The Canadian company already operates regulated gaming sites in France, Italy, Denmark, Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Romania.

It also owns PokerStars, the world's largest online poker site, which it acquired for $4.9 billion in 2014.
