#  Swaziland's biggest slot machine jackpot yet!

Earlier this week, a lucky Swazi player hit the country's biggest slot machine jackpot yet at a local casino. The lucky winner walked away with over $162,000 after playing for just a few minutes.

The casino declined to release the player's identity, but did say that he was extremely excited and still in disbelief about his win. When asked what he planned to do with the money, the player said that he was going to use it to take care of his family and buy a new car.

This latest jackpot comes on the heels of several other big wins at Swazi casinos in recent months. In January, another player hit a jackpot worth over $100,000. And in March, a player took home over $50,000 from a single spin at one of the casinos.

Swaziland's gambling industry has been growing rapidly in recent years, thanks in part to the country's weak currency. This has made it an attractive destination for international players, who can enjoy high-stakes games while spending relatively little money.

Slot machines have been particularly popular among gamblers in Swaziland, and it seems that every week brings another record-breaking jackpot. With millions up for grabs at any given time, it's no wonder that players are flocking to the casinos in droves!

A huge jackpot of five million Swazi emalangeni (US$667,000) has struck the casino in the kingdom’s capital, Mbabane.

The win was made by a 36-year-old male customer who had been playing blackjack, the Swazi Observer newspaper reported.

“We are very excited about this big win and we hope it will make someone very happy,” said an official from the casino, which is located inside the Manzini Sun Hotel.

Swaziland is a small landlocked country in southern Africa with a population of just over 1.3 million people. It is one of the poorest countries in the world, with almost half of its population living below the poverty line.

The casino industry has been growing in recent years as more and more people seek to hit it big. In 2017, a South African man won nearly US$2 million at one of the country’s casinos.
