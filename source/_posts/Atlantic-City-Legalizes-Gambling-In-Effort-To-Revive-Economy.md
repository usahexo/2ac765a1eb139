#  Atlantic City Legalizes Gambling In Effort To Revive Economy

In a last-ditch effort to revive its flagging economy, the New Jersey legislature has legalized gambling in Atlantic City. The casino resort town, once a premier destination for gambling, has been in steady decline in recent years as neighboring states legalized gambling and drew business away.

Under the new law, any of Atlantic City's twelve casinos can apply for a license to offer sports betting. In addition, the law allows for the creation of up to six new casinos in the city.

Atlantic City Mayor Don Guardian hailed the passage of the bill as a "game changer" for the city. "This is an historic day for Atlantic City and our residents," Guardian said in a statement. "We are proud to be leading the way in legalizing sports betting and creating jobs and economic growth."

Supporters of the measure say that it will bring much-needed revenue to Atlantic City, which has seen its ratable base decline by more than $3 billion since its peak in 2006. They also argue that it will create jobs, as the new casinos are expected to generate 5,000 construction jobs and another 10,000 permanent jobs.

Opponents of the measure say that it will simply hasten the city's decline by encouraging more people to gamble. They also note that many of the jobs created by the new casinos will be low-wage positions.

#  Atlantic City Legalizes Gambling To Boost Tourism

Atlantic City has seen better days. The iconic coastal town that was once a popular tourist destination has been struggling in recent years as neighboring states legalized gambling, drawing away potential visitors. In an attempt to boost tourism, the New Jersey state legislature passed a bill on Monday that legalized gambling in Atlantic City casinos.

The new law will allow for the operation of internet gambling, as well as new forms of casino games, such as table poker, blackjack, and roulette. Slots and other electronic gaming machines have been legal in New Jersey since 1976, but the legalization of other table games is seen as a way to attract more high-rolling gamblers to Atlantic City casinos.

Casino executives are hopeful that the new law will help revive Atlantic City's flagging tourism industry. "This is great news for Atlantic City and its casino industry," saidal Cardinale, CEO of Caesars Entertainment East Coast. "The legalization of additional table games will help us compete with our neighboring states and drive more visitors to our properties."

The passage of the bill was not without controversy, however. Some lawmakers argued that legalizing gambling would lead to an increase in crime and social problems. Others expressed concerns that the new law would cannibalize revenue from the state's already struggling horse racing industry.

Nonetheless, Governor Chris Christie signed the bill into law on Monday afternoon. "This legislation marks another important step in our efforts to make Atlantic City a world-class resort destination," he said.

#  Atlantic City Legalizes Gambling To Battle Casino Closures

In a last ditch effort to save Atlantic City's casino industry, the New Jersey legislature has legalized gambling in the city. The law went into effect on October 26, and makes it legal for casinos in Atlantic City to offer online gaming, sports betting, and poker.

The legalization of gambling is seen as a way to keep the city's casino industry alive, as more and more casinos have been closing in recent years. In fact, there are now just seven casinos remaining in Atlantic City, down from twelve in 2014.

Atlantic City's casino industry has been struggling for some time now due to competition from casinos in neighboring states. Pennsylvania, New York, and Delaware all have casinos that are much closer to Atlantic City than the casinos in those states are to one another.

The legalization of gambling will hopefully help to stem the tide of casino closures in Atlantic City. It is estimated that the new law could generate as much as $1 billion in revenue for the city's casinos each year. In addition, it is thought that the law could create as many as 10,000 new jobs in Atlantic City.

While some people are welcoming the legalization of gambling as a way to save the city's casino industry, others are concerned about its potential negative impacts. Some worry that the influx of gambling will lead to an increase in crime and addiction rates in Atlantic City. Others point out that the new law will likely benefit only the city's larger casinos while doing little to help smaller casinos that are struggling financially.

#  Atlantic City Legalizes Gambling To Attract New Businesses

In an effort to revitalize its economy, Atlantic City has legalized gambling. The goal is to attract new businesses and revenue to the city.

Atlantic City was once a popular tourist destination, but its popularity has declined in recent years. The legalization of gambling is seen as a way to revive the city’s economy.

 Casinos have long been a staple of the Atlantic City landscape, but the legalization of other forms of gambling, such as online gambling and sports betting, could bring in new revenue streams.

The future of Atlantic City now rests on the success of its gambling industry. If it can attract new businesses and revenue, then the city may be able to turnaround its fortunes. However, if the gambling industry fails to generate the expected results, then Atlantic City could find itself in even more trouble.

#  Atlantic City Legalizes Gambling To Preserve Local Jobs

Atlantic City, long known as a gambling hotspot, has legalized gambling once again in an effort to preserve jobs in the local area.

The legislation, which was passed unanimously by the city council, allows for up to five new casinos to be built in Atlantic City. In addition, the bill allows for existing casinos to expand their operations.

Mayor Don Guardian hailed the passage of the bill as a victory for the city.

“This is a great day for Atlantic City and its workers,” Guardian said. “We have worked hard to come up with a plan that will save our casino industry and create new jobs.”

Supporters of the bill say it will help to preserve the more than 15,000 jobs that are currently at stake in the city. They argue that without the new casinos and expansions, many of those jobs would be lost.

Opponents of the bill, however, argue that it will lead to an increase in crime and other social problems. They also argue that it is unfair to give preferential treatment to one industry over others.
