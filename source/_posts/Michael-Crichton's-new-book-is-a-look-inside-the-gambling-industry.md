#  Michael Crichton's new book is a look inside the gambling industry

Michael Crichton is back with a new book, and this time he's looking at the gambling industry. The book is called "Dragon Teeth" and is set in the early days of paleontology. It tells the story of two young men who are on opposite sides of the debate over how dinosaurs should be studied.

One of the interesting things about Crichton's new book is that it's based on real events. As Crichton explains in an interview with NPR, "Dragon Teeth" is "based on a true story, which I discovered when I was doing my research." He goes on to say that "the characters are fictional, but the actual events are based on history."

Crichton has always been known for his ability to combine fact and fiction in his writing, and "Dragon Teeth" looks to be no exception. The novel is sure to be filled with the same kind of suspense and excitement that has made Crichton such a popular author over the years.

#  How Michael Crichton became a casino owner

Michael Crichton, the author of Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain, had a varied and interesting career. In addition to being a best-selling author, he was also a movie producer, director, and screenwriter. But his most surprising career move may have been when he became a casino owner.

Crichton first became involved in the casino business in 1993, when he teamed up with Steve Wynn to open the Mirage Resorts Casino in Las Vegas. The two men had a falling out, and Crichton later opened his own casino, the Inn at Spanish Bay, in Pebble Beach, California.

The Inn at Spanish Bay was different from other casinos in that it catered to high-end customers. It offered luxury accommodations and fine dining options. The casino also had a spa and golf course.

The Inn at Spanish Bay was not a financial success, and Crichton eventually sold it. He later said that he had made a mistake by trying to cater to too high a level of customer. "The people who can afford to stay there are not going to gamble," he said.

#  What Thunder Area Casino means for the small town of Durant, Oklahoma

Durant, Oklahoma is a small town of about 15,000 people. While it may be small, it is home to one of the newest and most talked about casinos in the country: Thunder Area Casino. The casino is owned by the Chickasaw Nation, which is a federally recognized tribe of Native Americans.

The opening of the casino has been a big boon for Durant and its residents. The casino has created hundreds of jobs in the area and has brought in millions of dollars in revenue. In fact, the casino is so successful that the tribe has already announced plans to expand it.

The casino has also been a big boost for the local economy. It has attracted new businesses to Durant and helped existing businesses grow. The casino has also helped to attract new tourists to Durant and the surrounding area.

While the casino is a big win for Durant, it has also had some negative consequences. There have been concerns about increased crime rates and gambling addiction rates in the area. However, overall the casino has been a positive development for Durant and its residents.

The donation, which is worth $500,000, will be used to help fund new programs and purchases for the schools in Durant. In addition to this recent donation, Crichton has also given smaller donations to schools throughout his career.
