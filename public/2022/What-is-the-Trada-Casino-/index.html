<h1 id="What-is-the-Belarus"><a href="#What-is-the-Belarus" class="headerlink" title="What is the Belarus?"></a>What is the Belarus?</h1><p>Belarus, officially the Republic of Belarus, is a landlocked country in Eastern Europe. It is bordered by Russia to the north and east, Ukraine to the south, Poland to the west, and Lithuania and Latvia to the north-west. The capital is Minsk. Over 40% of Belarus is forested. Its longest river, the Dnieper, forms part of Belarus’s northern border with Russia. </p>
<p>The name “Belarus” derives from the name of the area’s oldest city, Balanjukh (now Belaja Zerkov), which was first mentioned in 1019 AD. The name was presumably derived from the Baltic word balts meaning “white”, cognate to Slavic blakl meaning “black”. </p>
<p>Part of the Soviet Union following World War II, Belarus declared its independence as a sovereign state on 25 August 1991. Alexander Lukashenko has been president since 1994. Belarus has been labeled “Europe’s last dictatorship” by some Western journalists and scholars. </p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-history-of-Belarus"><a href="#What-is-the-history-of-Belarus" class="headerlink" title="What is the history of Belarus?"></a>What is the history of Belarus?</h1><p>The history of Belarus started with migrations into the area from around 1000 BC onwards. Between 200 BC and 300 AD local Finno-Ugric tribes founded agricultural settlements on the lands where Minsk would later be built. These people were eventually assimilated by Proto-Slavic tribes who migrated into the area in the Early Middle Ages. These tribes also mixed with Scandinavian Great Moravia settlers who colonized areas along river Dvina in Northwestern Belarus in 862–863 AD. In addition, Polotsk Principality was established by Vladimir I of Kiev between 862 and 882 AD. It allied with Byzantine Empire against Kievan Rus’. </p>
<p>In 1240 Tatars invaded and destroyed many cities including Minsk but left much pagan heritage behind them which would shape modern Belarusian culture and traditions; for example Tatar loanwords are still present in Modern Belarusian language despite decades of Russification policy conducted by Russian Empire and Soviet Union authorities particularly during Stalinist period when almost all indigenous languages were banned for usage except Russian language which became mandatory in schools, universities, workplaces across Soviet Union . </p>
<p>In 1320s–1350s Grand Duchy of Lithuania was formed out of former Kievan Rus’ territories including modern-day Belarus; it became one of strongest states in Eastern Europe and battled against Teutonic Knights during Crusades Local Lithuanian magnates became increasingly powerful; some even established their own protectorates like Radziwiłł family did in 15th century when they received Kiev Voivodeship from Casimir IV Jagiellon King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania what would eventually evolve into Ruthenian Voivodeship encompassing most of modern-day Ukraine &amp; Byelorussia excluding Moscow principality . Many Ruthenian peasants chose to flee eastwards rather than convert to Catholicism .<br>At its height under Sigismund Augustus (1548–1572) GDL included Belorussia &amp; Volhynia as well other territories lost by Muscovy such as Chernigov , Tver , Novgorod &amp; Smolensk . After long wars with Moscow CIS it lost most these territories by end 17th century with exception Vilnius which became partRussian Empire after three partitionsof Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795 .<br>In 1812 Russian Empire invaded; Napoleon briefly occupied Minsk before his Grande Armée was pushed out later that year Following Congress of Vienna partitioning Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Russia took over most of modern day Belorussia while Congress Poland was created out Austrian Empire’s territory comprising westernmost territories suchClassical Podolia , Volhynia &amp; Galicia ; this would later evolve intoGeneral Governmentwith capital at Warsaw . Austria got Bukovina &amp; Transylvania . By 1914 there were over 2 million Poles living East Prussia ; 1 million Germans lived Russian Partition .<br>Soviet Union gained control over almost all of Belorussia following Red Army’s victory over Nazi Germany in World War II ; immediately afterwards NKVD commenced large scale deportations &amp; executions targeting native intelligentsia , priests , officers collaborating with Germans as well as millions rural residents considered potential threat Stalinist regime ; whole nation went through period industrialization &amp; collectivization which led to famine known as Holodomor claiming up to 7 million lives</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-EFL-Championship"><a href="#What-is-the-EFL-Championship" class="headerlink" title="What is the EFL Championship?"></a>What is the EFL Championship?</h1><p>The English Football League Championship, often abbreviated to EFL Championship, is a professional football league in England. The league is the second tier of the English football league system. The Championship was founded in 2004 as the FA Premier League was split into the Premier League and the Football League. The Championship is contested by 24 teams, with the winner gaining promotion to the Premier League, and the runner-up playing in a one-off match against the third-placed team from the Premier League to determine who will play in the top flight next season. </p>
<p>The Championship is a very competitive division, with many good players and managers on display. It can be argued that some of the best talent in world football can be found in this division. Some notable players who have played in or are currently playing in The Championship include: Gareth Bale, Mohamed Salah, Wilfried Zaha, Ruben Neves, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling. </p>
<p>The Championship has also been home to some very successful clubs over the years. These clubs have achieved great things both domestically and in European competition. Some of these clubs include Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, Derby County, Ipswich Town and Nottingham Forest. </p>
<p>In recent years, however, The Championship has been dominated by two teams: Wolverhampton Wanderers and Cardiff City. These two teams have won four of the last five Championships between them and look set to battle it out for supremacy once again this season.</p>
