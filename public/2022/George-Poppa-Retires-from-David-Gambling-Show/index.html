George Poppa Passes Away"></a>George Poppa has announced his retirement from the David Gambling show after many years of service. George Poppa Passes Away</h1><p>After a long and prosperous career as a guest on the David Gambling Show, George Poppa has announced his retirement. The 91-year-old World War II veteran has become a fixture of the talk show circuit, and his wit and wisdom will be sorely missed.</p>
<p>George Poppa first began appearing on the David Gambling Show in 1999, and since then he has charmed audiences with his stories of life in the military and his travels around the world. He was also known for his sharp sense of humor, which often got him into trouble with the other guests on the show.</p>
<p>In a statement released to the press, George Poppa said: “I’ve had a great time talking to David Gambling over the years, but it’s time for me to retire. I’ll be leaving with fond memories of all the great times we’ve had together.”</p>
<p>David Gambling paid tribute to George Poppa on Twitter, calling him “one of my favorite guests ever”. He added: “Thank you for all the laughs, George. You will be missed!”</p>
<p>Fans of the David Gambling Show have taken to social media to express their sadness at George Poppa’s retirement. Many say that he was one of their favorite guests, and they will miss hearing his stories and jokes.</p>
<p>George Poppa is survived by his wife Gloria, six children, and seven grandchildren. He will be greatly missed by all who knew him.</p>
<h1 id="George-Poppa-has-passed-away-at-the-age-of-8-George-Poppa-A-True-Legend"><a href="#George-Poppa-has-passed-away-at-the-age-of-8-George-Poppa-A-True-Legend" class="headerlink" title="George Poppa has passed away at the age of 8 George Poppa: A True Legend"></a>George Poppa has passed away at the age of 8 George Poppa: A True Legend</h1><p>I first met George Poppa in 1989 when I was just 8 years old. I was out playing ball in the street with my friends when I saw this old, beat-up pickup truck pull up to the curb. Out of the truck stepped the most impressive looking dog I had ever seen. He was huge! And he had a shiny black coat that gleamed in the sun.<br>I approached George and we became best friends instantly. We would spend hours playing catch in the street and exploring the city together. George taught me so much about life and about being a man. He showed me how to be brave and fearless, and how to always stand up for what’s right.<br>He was more than just a friend to me, he was like a father figure. And I will never forget all the wonderful things he taught me.</p>
<p>George Poppa passed away last month at the age of 8, but his legacy will live on forever. He was an amazing dog, and a true legend in our city. He will be missed by us all.</p>

George Poppa Remembered fondly by David Gambling"></a>George Poppa will be remembered as one of the greats in the history of sports gambling. George Poppa Remembered fondly by David Gambling</h1><p>It is with great sadness that we say goodbye to George Poppa, one of the pioneers of sports gambling. He was a master of his craft and a true gentleman in the industry.</p>
<p>George got his start in the business in 1973 when he opened the first sportsbook in Atlantic City. He was a shrewd businessman and had a keen eye for spotting opportunities. His sportsbooks were always well-run and profitable, and he was known for his fair and honest dealings with customers.</p>
<p>George was a major figure in the development of online gambling as well. He was one of the first people to see the potential of the internet as a gambling medium, and he helped to shape the industry as it exists today.</p>
<p>His influence extended beyond gambling as well. He was a mentor to many in the industry and was always willing to share his knowledge and experience with others. He will be greatly missed by all who knew him.</p>
<p>Thank you, George, for your contributions to the gambling world. You will be remembered as one of its greats.</p>

George Poppa: The Man, The Myth, The Legend"></a>David Gambling pays tribute to the late George Poppa, a giant in the world of sports gambling. George Poppa: The Man, The Myth, The Legend</h1><p>There are very few people in the world of sports gambling who have had the impact and notoriety as George Poppa. The 75-year old was a giant in the industry, renowned for his accuracy and uncanny ability to predict sports outcomes.</p>
<p>Poppa, who died last week after a long battle with cancer, was a fixture at many major Las Vegas casinos, where he would take on anyone -– regardless of their experience –- in a game of blackjack or poker. He was also well known for his work as a sports handicapper, working for various publications over the years and developing a loyal following among gamblers nationwide.</p>
<p>“George was one of the shrewdest minds in this business,” said David Gambling, a professional gambler and author of “The Gambler’s Bible.” “He always seemed to have an edge on the competition, whether it was in blackjack or betting on sports. I always looked forward to hearing his picks; I knew I could make some serious money if I followed them.”</p>
<p>Born and raised in Boston, Poppa got his start in the gambling world at an early age. He quickly learned the ropes playing cards with his friends and family, and soon began making a name for himself as a top player. After moving to Las Vegas in the early 1970s, Poppa turned his attention to sports gambling, where he soon became one of the most successful players in the country.</p>
<p>“George was one of the pioneers of sports betting,” said longtime friend and fellow gambler Tommy Vinson. “He really helped shape how we bet on sports today. He was always ahead of the curve.”</p>
<p>Poppa’s expertise wasn’t confined to just football and basketball; he was also known for his success when betting on horse racing events. In fact, he once cashed in on a $1 million dollar ticket after correctly predicting the winners of 14 races at Churchill Downs.</p>
<p>“George was one of the best there ever was when it came to betting on horses,” said Vinson. “He had an uncanny knack for picking winners, no matter what track they were running at.”</p>
<p>In addition to his success as a gambler, Poppa will also be remembered for his generous spirit and warm personality. He was quick to help out friends in need and always willing to share his knowledge with others who were interested in learning about gambling strategies.</p>
<p>“George was more than just a great gambler,” said Gambling. “He was also a great friend and someone who always had time for others. His loss is truly felt by all who had the privilege of knowing him.”</p>

He got his start as a bookie in the late 1940s, when sports gambling was still in its infancy. At the time, most bets were placed through a network of illegal bookies, and there was very little regulation or oversight.</p>
<p>Poppa quickly established himself as one of the top bookies in the business, and he soon began to make a fortune. He was known for his keen insight into the game, and he was often able to beat the odds and win big bets.</p>
<p>Poppa’s success led him to form his own bookmaking operation, which soon became one of the most successful in the country. He employed a team of experts who helped him to make shrewd predictions about how games would play out.</p>
<p>In addition to his gambling exploits, Poppa was also a successful businessman. He owned several restaurants and nightclubs in Las Vegas, which helped him to amass a considerable fortune.</p>
<p>Sadly, George Poppa passed away in 2017 at the age of 95. But even though he is no longer with us, his legacy will never be forgotten. He was instrumental in shaping the world of sports gambling, and his exploits will always be remembered by those who love betting on sports.</p>
